# Manga Viewer Application

This is a simple manga reader app built in pure Java with no additional dependancies or libraries at play. In order to run the app you can use Java's compilation tools or any valid compiler you wish.

## Setting up your library

This project makes use of the standardized `.cbz` file format to represent manga/comics. When opening the application you will need to upload your library to the app and it will be stored within the Manga folder. If you are recieving an error make sure a `Manga` folder exists within the same directory as this project however by design the program should be creating this folder automatically.
